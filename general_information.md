Abstract:
UAV navigation within GPS-denied environments has become increasingly critical in recent years due to modern heavy reliance on GPS and the rise of UAV use within GPS-denied and GPS-unstable zones. GPS reliance marks on the of the largest weaknesses of most autonomous UAV systems, and the loss of GPS signal often renders many autonomous UAVs as completely coordinately-impaired. To confront this issue, we present the implementation of a navigational system based on terrain imaging and dead reckoning for home-oriented navigation, which is viable even in foreign environments. We explore the possibility of various forms of image processing, such as feature matching and optical flow via template matching, in order to replicate similar data (ground speed, initial and ending orientation comparison) that would have otherwise been produced by GPS outputs. We use traditional dead reckoning methods as a path basis for the initial UAV navigation, and we utilize both physical implementation and formal methods to study the general applicability of this solution.
